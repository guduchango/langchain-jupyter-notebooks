# 🧠 LangChain Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different use cases and patterns using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/). The goal is to build a hands-on, evolving knowledge base to understand how to combine LLMs with tools like vector stores, custom prompts, document loaders, and more.

## 🚀 What's inside?

Each notebook explores a different feature or capability of LangChain:

- Chunking and splitting documents
- Creating and querying vector databases
- Using custom prompt templates
- Integrating local LLMs via Ollama
- ...and more coming soon

> ✅ The notebooks are written to be clear, modular, and beginner-friendly. Feel free to clone, run, and adapt them.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run the notebooks, you’ll need:

- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- LangChain, Chroma, Ollama, and other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` *(to be added)*
