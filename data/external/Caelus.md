# Caelus Winery - High-Altitude Wines

**Motto:** "Wines that are a conversation between the sky, the soil, and the vine."

## 1. Philosophy: Heaven in a Bottle

**Caelus Winery** (from the Latin for "sky" or "heaven") is a family project born in 2012 out of an obsession with interpreting one of the world's most extreme and fascinating terroirs: Gualtallary, in the Uco Valley, Mendoza.

Our philosophy is one of minimal intervention. We don't "make" wine; rather, we guide the grape to express the pure identity of our vineyard, which is defined by high altitude, limestone soils, and a relentless thermal amplitude. We practice organic viticulture and apply biodynamic principles to ensure a living, self-sustaining ecosystem. Each bottle is a liquid reflection of the sky and earth of Gualtallary.

## 2. Our Terroir: Gualtallary, Uco Valley

- **Altitude:** Our vineyard is located at **1,450 meters (4,757 feet)** above sea level, one of the highest areas in Mendoza. This guarantees high solar intensity and very cold nights, resulting in grapes with thick skins, great concentration of color, aromas, and a vibrant natural acidity.
- **Soil:** Predominantly alluvial and rocky, with a high content of calcium carbonate (limestone). This poor, well-draining soil restricts the plant's vigor, concentrating all its energy into the few clusters it produces. It imparts a unique mineral, almost saline, texture to the wine.
