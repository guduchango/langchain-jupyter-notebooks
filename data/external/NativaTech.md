# NativaTech Wear: Brand Manual, Products & Policies - 2025 Edition

**Last Updated:** July 24, 2025

## 1. Our Story and Philosophy

**NativaTech Wear** was founded in 2018 by Ana Rojas and Mateo Benítez, two climbers and industrial designers, in a small workshop in El Chaltén, Patagonia. Frustrated by the lack of locally available gear that could withstand the unpredictability of the Patagonian climate while also being environmentally friendly, they decided to create it themselves.

Our philosophy is built on three pillars:
1.  **Extreme Performance:** Every garment is designed and tested in the harshest conditions of Patagonia.
2.  **Real Sustainability:** We minimize our impact through innovative materials and a circular product lifecycle.
3.  **Functional Design:** We believe form follows function. Every seam, pocket, and zipper has a purpose.

## 2. Core Technology: The AndesFiber™

Our most significant innovation is the registered technical textile, **AndesFiber™**, which we developed in-house. It's not a single fabric, but a laminated three-layer system.

- **Outer Layer (The Shield):** Composed of a 100% recycled PET bottle *ripstop* fabric. It features a next-generation, PFC-free DWR (Durable Water Repellent) treatment.
- **Middle Layer (The Core):** This is the waterproof and breathable membrane. It boasts a waterproof rating of **20,000mm** and a breathability rating of **15,000 g/m²/24h**. This membrane blocks water entry while allowing sweat to escape.
- **Inner Layer (The Comfort):** A soft-to-the-touch microfleece made from a blend of llama wool and organic cotton, providing warmth and excellent moisture management.
