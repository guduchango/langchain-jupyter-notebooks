# Urbana Cero: Smart Fashion for the City - 2025 Collection

**Manifesto:** Efficiency is the new elegance. We create garments for creative professionals navigating the city, who value time, functionality, and a flawless style with minimal effort.

## 1. Concept and Foundation

**Urbana Cero** was born in 2020 in the heart of the Palermo district, Buenos Aires, from the minds of fashion designer Julieta Díaz and software engineer Lucas Koenig. The vision: to develop a clothing line that acts as an interface between the individual and their digital urban environment. Fewer decisions about what to wear, more time to create.

## 2. Our Technology: The MetroWeave™

Unlike traditional textiles, our patented **MetroWeave™** is a composite material.

- **Composition:** A blend of high-quality Pima cotton, Tencel™ (eucalyptus cellulose fiber), and memory-elastane microfilaments.
- **Nano-Shield Treatment:** Each fiber is coated with a nanoscopic layer of silica, creating a "lotus effect" that causes liquids (coffee, wine, rain) to bead up and roll off without staining.
- **"Zero-Crease" Property:** The memory fibers allow the garment to return to its original shape after being folded or packed, eliminating the need for ironing.
- **Integrated NFC Chip:** Every piece in the "Connection" collection has a small, passive NFC chip sewn into the sleeve or collar. It's imperceptible and requires no battery.
