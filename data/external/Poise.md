# Poise - Performance Workwear for Women

**Motto:** "Effortless Performance. Uncompromising Style."

## 1. Our Mission

**Poise** was founded by a team of female engineers and designers who were tired of choosing between comfort and career. For too long, women's workwear has been a compromise: either stiff and restrictive, or comfortable but unprofessional. We asked, "Why can't we have both?"

Our mission is to empower women to navigate the modern workday with confidence and ease. We engineer elegant, professional silhouettes with the hidden performance of high-tech athletic gear. Poise is for the woman leading a board meeting, catching a red-eye flight, and mentoring her team—all in the same day, and all in the same outfit.

## 2. Core Technology: Flex-Form™ Fabric

The secret behind every Poise garment is our proprietary **Flex-Form™** fabric. We developed it from the ground up to meet the demands of a dynamic professional life.

- **4-Way Stretch:** Moves with you, providing complete freedom of movement without losing its shape.
- **Wrinkle-Resistant:** Pack it in a suitcase or sit through a 10-hour flight. It will not wrinkle. Period.
- **Machine-Washable:** Forget the dry cleaner. Every piece, including our blazers, is designed to be machine washed and hung to dry, looking perfect every time.
- **Thermoregulating:** Micro-particle technology helps retain warmth in a cold office and release heat during a hectic commute.
- **Moisture-Wicking:** Draws moisture away from the skin to keep you feeling fresh and comfortable.

## 3. The Poise Standard: Signature Design Features

Every piece in our collection is thoughtfully designed with features that solve real-world problems.

- **Secure-Zip Pockets:** Deep, functional pockets that can actually hold a modern smartphone, with a hidden zipper to keep contents secure.
- **Action-Back Construction:** A discreet gusset, inspired by classic menswear tailoring, is built into the shoulder seams of our blazers, allowing for a full range of arm motion without pulling or restriction.
- **The 2-Inch Hem™:** A simple, brilliant internal hem system in our trousers that allows you to temporarily adjust the length by two inches—perfect for switching between flats and heels.
- **Stay-Fresh™ Lining:** Our linings are woven with a silver-ion thread that provides natural anti-odor properties, keeping you confident through long days.

## 6. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Are the pockets on the Catalyst Blazer actually real and functional?**
  - A: Yes, absolutely. They are a core feature of our design philosophy. The two external pockets are deep enough for a large phone or notebook, and the internal pocket is perfect for a passport or cards.

- **Q: How exactly do I machine wash the blazer?**
  - A: It's easy. Place the blazer in a mesh laundry bag, wash on a gentle cycle with cold water and mild detergent, and then hang it on a good-quality hanger to air dry. It will be ready to wear in a few hours, no ironing needed.

- **Q: How does the 2-Inch Hem™ work? Is it secure?**
  - A: The hem has a soft, flexible inner lining with two small, discreet anchor points. You simply fold the hem up to the desired length and loop the anchors into place. It's completely secure for a full day of wear but easy to reverse.

- **Q: Is your sizing inclusive?**
  - A: We currently offer sizes from 00 to 20 and are actively working on expanding our size range to be even more inclusive in the coming year.
