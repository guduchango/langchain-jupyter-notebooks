# Little Sprouts Organics - Clothes for Childhood

**Motto:** "Durable for adventures, soft for cuddles, kind to the planet."

## 1. Our Philosophy

**Little Sprouts Organics** was founded by parents for parents. We were tired of children's clothes that were either beautiful but delicate, or durable but made with harsh chemicals. Our mission is to create joyful, practical, and incredibly safe clothing that can keep up with the tumbles and triumphs of childhood. Every piece is designed to be a hand-me-down favorite.

## 2. Our Core Principles

- **100% GOTS Certified Organic Cotton:** We only use the purest cotton, grown without pesticides or synthetic fertilizers, ensuring it's gentle on sensitive skin.
- **Non-Toxic Dyes:** All our colors and prints use low-impact, water-based dyes that are certified free from harmful substances.
- **Ethical Production:** Our garments are made in a Fair Trade Certified factory, ensuring that the skilled people who make our clothes are paid a living wage and work in safe conditions.
- **Built for Play:** We believe clothes should be an invitation to explore. Our designs prioritize comfort and freedom of movement.

## 3. Signature Features

Every Little Sprouts garment includes thoughtful details:
- **Grow-With-Me™ Cuffs:** Extra-long, foldable cuffs on all sleeves and pant legs that can be unrolled to add up to 3 inches of length as your child grows.
- **Reinforced Knees:** All our pants and playsuits feature a double layer of fabric on the knees to withstand crawling, climbing, and playground fun.
- **Sensory-Friendly Seams:** We use flatlock stitching and print our labels directly onto the fabric to eliminate itchy tags and seams.

## 5. The Re-Sprout™ Program

We are committed to a circular future. When your child outgrows their Little Sprouts items, don't throw them away!

2.  Receive a **20% credit** towards your next purchase.
3.  We inspect the returned items. If they are in good condition, we donate them to our charity partners. If they are too well-loved, we send them to our textile recycling partner.

## 6. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Are your clothes pre-shrunk?**
  - A: Yes, all our fabrics are pre-shrunk to minimize shrinking at home. We recommend washing cold and tumbling dry on low.

- **Q: What does GOTS certified mean?**
  - A: GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) is the highest worldwide standard for organic fibers. It certifies not just the organic farming of the cotton, but also the entire production process, from non-toxic dyes to ethical labor practices.

- **Q: How does the Grow-With-Me™ feature work?**
  - A: The cuffs on sleeves and pant legs are designed with extra length and a snug fit. You start with them folded up, and as your child's arms and legs get longer, you simply unroll the cuff to reveal more length.

# TerraThread Collective - Essentials, Reimagined.

**Motto:** "Wear your values. Radically transparent, consciously crafted."

## 1. Our Mission

**TerraThread Collective** was founded on a simple question: What if a fashion brand hid nothing? We are an open book. We challenge the norms of the fashion industry by revealing the true costs behind our products, championing next-generation materials, and committing to a cruelty-free, planet-first philosophy. We create timeless essentials designed to be worn, loved, and debated.

## 2. Our Materials Glossary

The story of our products is the story of their materials.

- **Myco-Leather™:** Our proprietary, 100% vegan leather grown from mycelium (the root structure of mushrooms). It is incredibly soft, breathable, and biodegradable. It has a natural, matte finish and develops a unique patina over time.
- **Sea-Spun™ Cotton:** A premium jersey fabric knit from a blend of 60% GOTS Organic Cotton and 40% yarn made from upcycled ocean-bound plastic bottles collected by our partners.
- **Hemp-Denim:** A classic denim weave made from a blend of organic cotton and hemp. Hemp requires significantly less water than conventional cotton and naturally enriches the soil it grows in.
- **Corozo Nut Buttons:** "Vegetable ivory." Our buttons are carved from the dried nuts of the Tagua palm tree. They are beautiful, durable, and completely plastic-free.

- **End-of-Life Take-Back:** When you are truly done with your garment, send it back to us. We will ensure it is either repaired and resold in our "Renewed" section, or fully disassembled and recycled. You will receive a $20 credit.

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Is Myco-Leather™ waterproof?**
  - A: It is naturally water-resistant, similar to traditional animal leather, but not fully waterproof. It will withstand a light shower. We do not use plastic coatings to maintain its breathability.

- **Q: Why do you show your cost breakdown?**
  - A: We believe in radical transparency. By showing you the true costs behind a garment, we empower you to make informed decisions and understand the value of conscious craftsmanship.

- **Q: How does the Sea-Spun™ fabric feel? Is it soft?**
  - A: Yes, it's incredibly soft. The recycled yarn is processed to be indistinguishable from virgin fibers, and when blended with our premium organic cotton, the result is a smooth, breathable jersey that feels great against the skin.
