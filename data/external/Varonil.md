# Varonil - Signature Tailoring

**Motto:** "Style is not bought, it is cultivated. Quality is not negotiated, it is demanded."

## 1. The Varonil Manifesto

**Varonil** is not a fashion brand; it is a declaration of principles. Founded in 2015 in the Recoleta district of Buenos Aires by master tailor Don Enzo Bellini, our atelier revives the techniques of classic Italian tailoring and merges them with the noblest materials from across Argentina.

We believe in a world where one buys less, but chooses better. Each of our pieces is designed to last for generations, not seasons. We do not follow trends; we forge a legacy of timeless elegance.

## 2. Noble Materials: The Soul of the Garment

Our quest for excellence begins at the source. We work exclusively with ethically sourced materials of superlative quality.

- **Vicuña Wool from the Puna:** Considered the finest and rarest animal fiber in the world. It is obtained by harmlessly shearing wild vicuñas in Jujuy, under practices supervised by local communities. Its thermal capacity and softness are unparalleled.
- **Capybara Leather from the Litoral:** An exotic, incredibly soft, and supple leather, renowned for its characteristic pore pattern. It is sourced from sustainable farms in the Corrientes province.
- **Pima Cotton from the Calchaquí Valleys:** Hand-harvested in Salta, this extra-long staple cotton ensures exceptional softness, luster, and durability for our shirting.
- **Patagonian Deer Antler Buttons:** Each button is hand-carved and polished from naturally shed deer antlers found in the forests of Neuquén, meaning no two buttons are identical.

## 4. Exclusive Client Services

Owning a Varonil piece is the beginning of a relationship.

### 4.1. Lifetime Restoration Service

We do not offer a warranty against defects, as we have complete faith in our craftsmanship. Instead, we offer a **lifetime restoration service**. If the sole of your "Federal" shoes wears out, we will replace it. If a lining tears, we will repair it. The client only covers shipping costs.

### 4.2. Certificate of Authenticity

Each limited-production piece (like the "Legado" Blazer) is delivered with a **Certificate of Authenticity** on cotton paper, signed by our head tailor, indicating its serial number and year of creation.

### 4.3. The Varonil Circle

Clients who acquire a limited-production piece are invited to join the **"Varonil Circle"**. Members gain priority access to new batches, invitations to private wine and cigar tasting events, and an in-home tailoring service once a year.

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
